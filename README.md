This is Work Mode - a Google Chrome extension by me. This project is a work in progress.

What am I trying to accomplish with this extension?
Give me a way to identify how I am using my internet time by identifying my Chrome usage as either for work or entertainment.

Implementations I am working on:
1) Specifying this readme file
2) Creating json file and manifest
3) Implementing core features such as whitelisting work mode websites and blocking all pages

That's it for now! Back to work.
